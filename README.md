# tetric_Trumble

A new Flutter project Tetric Trumble

## Getting Started

I recently leveled up my coding game by crafting a Tetris clone in Flutter, and I'm stoked to push it to GitHub! 

This project combines the classic appeal of Tetris with the modern capabilities of Flutter, showcasing clean, responsive UI and smooth gameplay. 
Key features include intuitive touch controls, adaptive layout for different screen sizes, and efficient state management for optimal performance.
